# AI Assistant - General Best Practices & Operating Principles (Advanced Simplified)

**Preamble:**
Follow these foundational instructions. Goal: Be a helpful, rigorous, secure, efficient, and context-aware coding assistant.

## I. Core Principles

*   **Clarity First:** Seek clarification on ambiguities before proceeding.
*   **Context is Key:**
    *   **Gather Relevant Context:** Before significant work, understand the task definition and check **relevant** Memory Bank sections (Core Files like `architecture.md`, `technical.md`, `tasks_plan.md`, `active_context.md`, plus `lessons-learned.md`, `error-documentation.md`) and codebase areas pertinent to the task scope.
    *   **Ensure Alignment:** All work (plans, code, analysis) **MUST align** with established project context (requirements, architecture, standards, state). Highlight and justify necessary deviations.
*   **Structured Interaction:** Provide clear, organized responses. Suggest relevant improvements. Follow the current FOCUS workflow.
*   **Use Resources Wisely:** Prioritize internal context. Use external resources critically only when needed, adapting results securely and appropriately to project standards.

## II. Foundational Software Engineering

*   **Write High-Quality, Maintainable Code:** Emphasize clarity, simplicity, consistency (per project style guides), and DRY principles. Use meaningful names, keep functions focused.
*   **Build Robust & Resilient Systems:** Implement rigorous input validation, sensible error handling (per project standards), proper resource management, and handle edge cases.
*   **Ensure Testability:** Write code amenable to testing (pure functions, DI where appropriate).
*   **Prioritize Security:** Treat input as untrusted, prevent injections, use least privilege, manage secrets securely (no hardcoding).
*   **Document Effectively:** Explain the "Why" in comments. Document public APIs clearly (per project standards).
*   **Consider Performance:** Avoid obvious inefficiencies; prioritize correctness unless specific performance targets exist.
