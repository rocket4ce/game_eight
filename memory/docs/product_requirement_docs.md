# Product Requirement Document (PRD) - GameEight

## 1. Introduction
* **Project Name:** GameEight
* **Document Version:** 1.0
* **Date:** September 6, 2025
* **Author(s):** Development Team
* **Purpose:** Define the requirements and scope for GameEight, a web application built with Phoenix LiveView.

## 2. Goals
* **Business Goals:**
  - Create an engaging web-based gaming platform
  - Demonstrate Phoenix LiveView capabilities for real-time interactive applications
  - Establish a foundation for multiplayer gaming experiences
* **User Goals:**
  - Provide users with an intuitive gaming interface
  - Enable real-time game interactions and updates
  - Deliver a responsive and engaging user experience

## 3. Background and Rationale
* **Problem:** Modern web gaming platforms often rely on heavy JavaScript frameworks that can be complex to maintain and have performance issues. There's a need for a simpler, more maintainable solution that still provides real-time interactivity.
* **Solution:** Leverage Phoenix LiveView to create a server-side rendered application with real-time capabilities, reducing client-side complexity while maintaining rich interactivity.
* **Target Market:** Web gaming enthusiasts, developers interested in Phoenix LiveView demonstrations, casual gamers looking for browser-based entertainment.

## 4. Scope
* **In Scope:**
  - Web-based gaming interface using Phoenix LiveView
  - Real-time game state management
  - Responsive UI with TailwindCSS styling
  - Basic game mechanics and user interactions
  - Development tooling and testing infrastructure
* **Out of Scope:**
  - Mobile native applications
  - Complex 3D graphics or WebGL integration
  - User authentication system (initial phase)
  - Payment processing or monetization features
  - Multi-language internationalization (initial phase)

## 5. Target Audience
* **Primary Users:**
  - Casual web gamers seeking browser-based entertainment
  - Developers interested in Phoenix LiveView capabilities
  - Gaming enthusiasts looking for real-time multiplayer experiences
* **User Characteristics:**
  - Comfortable with web browsers
  - Expects responsive and intuitive interfaces
  - Values real-time interactivity
  - May access from various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## 6. Requirements
### 6.1. Functional Requirements
* The system must provide a web-based gaming interface accessible via browser
* The system must support real-time game state updates using Phoenix LiveView
* The system must handle user interactions and game logic server-side
* The system must provide responsive design for multiple screen sizes
* The system must include proper error handling and user feedback
* The system must implement a multiplayer card game with the following specifications:
  - Two English decks (red and blue) totaling 104 cards
  - 2-6 players per game, each receiving 8 cards initially
  - Dice-based turn order determination
  - Card combinations: trios (3+ same value) and sequences (4+ consecutive same suit)
  - Player states: player_off (initial) and player_on (after first play)
  - Turn limits: 5 moves maximum, 4 cards from hand maximum per turn
  - Real-time card play, table updates, and turn management

### 6.2. Card Visibility and Privacy Rules
* **Player Hand Cards:** Each player can ONLY see their own hand cards - other players' hands are hidden
* **Table Cards:** All players can see all cards that have been played on the table (combinations made by any player)
* **Deck Cards:** Players can see the top card of the discard pile and know the remaining deck count, but cannot see specific cards in the deck
* **Private Information:** Each player's dice roll results, moves count, and hand size are visible to all players
* **Game State:** All players can see current turn indicator, game status, and public player statistics

### 6.3. Non-Functional Requirements
* **Performance:** Page load times under 2 seconds, real-time updates with minimal latency
* **Scalability:** Support for concurrent users (target: 100+ simultaneous players)
* **Reliability:** 99%+ uptime, graceful handling of connection issues
* **Security:** Protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS)
* **Maintainability:** Well-structured Elixir code following Phoenix conventions

### 6.3. Technical Requirements
* Built with Phoenix Framework v1.8+
* Uses Phoenix LiveView for real-time functionality
* Styled with TailwindCSS and Heroicons
* Database integration with PostgreSQL via Ecto
* RESTful API capabilities where needed
* Comprehensive test coverage

## 7. Success Criteria
* Successful deployment of functional gaming interface
* Real-time interactions working smoothly across browsers
* Positive user feedback on gameplay experience
* Clean, maintainable codebase following Phoenix best practices
* Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

## 8. Constraints and Dependencies
* **Technical Constraints:**
  - Must use Phoenix LiveView as primary frontend technology
  - Server-side rendering approach limits some client-side capabilities
  - Elixir/Phoenix ecosystem dependency
* **Dependencies:**
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Modern web browsers with WebSocket support
  - Stable internet connection for real-time features

## 9. Timeline and Milestones
* **Phase 1:** Basic application structure and routing
* **Phase 2:** Core game logic and LiveView implementation
* **Phase 3:** UI/UX refinement and styling
* **Phase 4:** Testing, optimization, and deployment

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
* **Risk:** Performance issues with complex real-time operations
  - **Mitigation:** Implement efficient state management and optimize LiveView processes
* **Risk:** Browser compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation:** Test across major browsers, provide fallbacks where needed
* **Risk:** Scalability challenges
  - **Mitigation:** Implement proper Phoenix PubSub patterns, optimize database queries
