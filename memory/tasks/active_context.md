- **Interface:** Modern graphical LiveView interface with real-time updates

### PHASE 1: Data Structures âœ… COMPLETED
**All foundational components implemented and tested:**

âœ… **Card Module** (`lib/game_eight/game/card.ex`):
- 104-card deck system with red/blue variants
- Trio validation (3+ same value cards, different suits)
- Sequence validation (3+ consecutive cards, same suit)
- Wrap-around sequence support (Q-K-A, K-A-2)
- DOM helpers and card conversion functions

âœ… **Game State Schema** (`lib/game_eight/game/game_state.ex`):
- Room association and player management
- Deck management and table combinations
- Turn order, current player tracking
- Dice results and game flow control
- JSON serialization for card data

âœ… **Player Game State Schema** (`lib/game_eight/game/player_game_state.ex`):
- Individual player hands with privacy
- Player status (player_off/player_on)
- Statistics tracking and dice rolls
- Card conversion with defensive programming

### PHASE 2: Game Engine âœ… COMPLETED
**Complete game logic implemented:**

âœ… **Game Engine** (`lib/game_eight/game/engine.ex`):

- Automatic 8-card dealing after all players roll dice
- Trio and sequence validation with advanced rules
- Combination expansion (add cards to existing combinations)
- Draw card functionality with automatic turn ending
- Pass turn and end turn mechanics
- Complete game state management

âœ… **Game Flow:**
1. Room creation and player joining
2. Auto game initialization with dice phase
3. All players roll dice â†’ automatic card dealing
4. Turn-based play with combination creation and expansion
5. Draw cards, play combinations, pass turns
6. Real-time updates for all players
