# Active Context - GameEight Development

## Current Work Focus
**Sprint Goal:** Card Game Implementation - PHASE COMPLETE âœ…
**Active Branch:** feature/game
**Current Status:** Full multiplayer card game implemented and tested

### Implementation Status: COMPLETED âœ…
**Game Type:** Multiplayer Card Game (Rummy-style with custom rules)
- **Decks:** 2 English decks (red/blue) = 104 cards total
- **Players:** 2-6 players, automatically receive 8 cards each after dice phase
- **Turn System:** Dice-based turn order (highest dice goes first)
- **Mechanics:** Trios (3+ same value), Escaleras/Sequences (3+ consecutive same suit)
- **Advanced Rules:** Wrap-around sequences (Q-K-A, K-A-2), combination expansion
- **Limits:** 5 moves max per turn, combination expansion after first play
- **Interface:** Modern graphical LiveView interface with real-time updates

### PHASE 1: Data Structures âœ… COMPLETED
**All foundational components implemented and tested:**

âœ… **Card Module** (`lib/game_eight/game/card.ex`):
- 104-card deck system with red/blue variants
- Trio validation (3+ same value cards, different suits)
- Sequence validation (3+ consecutive cards, same suit)
- Wrap-around sequence support (Q-K-A, K-A-2)
- DOM helpers and card conversion functions

âœ… **Game State Schema** (`lib/game_eight/game/game_state.ex`):
- Room association and player management
- Deck management and table combinations
- Turn order, current player tracking
- Dice results and game flow control
- JSON serialization for card data

âœ… **Player Game State Schema** (`lib/game_eight/game/player_game_state.ex`):
- Individual player hands with privacy
- Player status (player_off/player_on)
- Statistics tracking and dice rolls
- Card conversion with defensive programming

### PHASE 2: Game Engine âœ… COMPLETED
**Complete game logic implemented:**

âœ… **Game Engine** (`lib/game_eight/game/engine.ex`):
- Auto-initialization when rooms start
- Dice rolling with automatic turn order determination
- Automatic 8-card dealing after all players roll dice
- Trio and sequence validation with advanced rules
- Combination expansion (add cards to existing combinations)
- Draw card functionality with automatic turn ending
- Pass turn and end turn mechanics
- Complete game state management

âœ… **Game Flow:**
1. Room creation and player joining
2. Auto game initialization with dice phase
3. All players roll dice â†’ automatic card dealing
4. Turn-based play with combination creation and expansion
5. Draw cards, play combinations, pass turns
6. Real-time updates for all players

### PHASE 3: LiveView Interface âœ… COMPLETED
**Full real-time game interface implemented:**

âœ… **GameLive Module** (`lib/game_eight_web/live/game_live.ex`):
- Complete game interface with proper authentication
- Card visibility rules strictly enforced
- Interactive card selection with visual feedback
- Real-time game state updates
- Defensive programming against crashes

âœ… **Card Visibility Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED):**
- âœ… Each player sees ONLY their own hand cards (private)
- âœ… All players see cards on table (public combinations)
- âœ… Players see discard pile top card and deck count
- âœ… Other players' hands show only card count (hidden)

âœ… **Game Actions Interface:**
- âœ… Dice rolling with visual feedback
- âœ… Card selection with click toggle
- âœ… Trio creation (3+ same value cards)
- âœ… Escalera creation (3+ consecutive same suit)
- âœ… Combination expansion (add cards to existing combinations)
- âœ… Draw card and pass turn functionality
- âœ… Real-time turn management

âœ… **UI Components:**
- âœ… Responsive card display with suit symbols
- âœ… Player status and turn indicators
- âœ… Combination display with expansion buttons
- âœ… Error messaging and validation feedback
- âœ… Real-time PubSub updates

### PHASE 4: Testing & Quality âœ… COMPLETED
**Comprehensive test coverage:**

âœ… **Test Suite (155 tests passing):**
- âœ… Card validation tests (trio, sequences, wrap-around)
- âœ… Engine tests (initialization, dice rolling, card dealing)
- âœ… Game flow tests (turn management, combination creation)
- âœ… LiveView integration tests
- âœ… Edge case and defensive programming tests

âœ… **Advanced Game Rules Implemented:**
- âœ… 3-card minimum sequences (changed from 4)
- âœ… Wrap-around sequences: Q-K-A, K-A-2
- âœ… Combination expansion after first play
- âœ… Automatic 8-card dealing after dice phase
- âœ… Turn order based on dice results (highest first)
- âœ… Defensive programming against nil crashes

## Current Development State
