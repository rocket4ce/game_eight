# Active Context - GameEight Development

## Current Focus
**Primary Task:** Memory Bank Initialization and Project Analysis
**Current Phase:** Project Foundation Setup
**Date:** September 6, 2025
**Work Session:** Initial project analysis and documentation setup

## What We're Currently Working On

### Immediate Tasks in Progress
1. **Memory Bank Setup** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Successfully created all 7 required core Memory Bank files
   - Documented project requirements, architecture, and technical stack
   - Established task planning and tracking structure

### Just Completed
- **Project Analysis:** Analyzed existing Phoenix application structure
- **Technology Assessment:** Documented current tech stack and dependencies
- **Architecture Documentation:** Created comprehensive system architecture diagrams
- **Task Planning:** Outlined complete development roadmap with priorities

## Current Project State

### What's Working
- **Basic Phoenix Application:** Standard Phoenix 1.8 app structure is in place
- **Database Setup:** PostgreSQL configuration exists
- **Asset Pipeline:** TailwindCSS and ESBuild configured
- **Development Tools:** Mix tasks and aliases properly configured
- **Code Quality:** Precommit task includes formatting and testing

### What's Available
- **Web Framework:** Phoenix 1.8 with LiveView 1.1
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with Heroicons
- **Database:** Ecto with PostgreSQL
- **HTTP Client:** Req library for external requests
- **Email:** Swoosh for email functionality
- **Development Tools:** Live reload, dashboard, and debugging tools

### What's Missing/Needs Implementation
- **Game Logic:** No game-specific code exists yet
- **Game Models:** Database schemas for games and players
- **Real-time Features:** LiveView implementation for game interactions
- **UI Components:** Game-specific components and interfaces
- **Business Logic:** Game rules, state management, and validation

## Recent Decisions and Context

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Server-Side State Management:** Using Phoenix LiveView for real-time game state
2. **Database Strategy:** PostgreSQL with Ecto for persistent storage
3. **UI Framework:** TailwindCSS for styling with Phoenix Components
4. **Real-time Communication:** Phoenix PubSub for game updates
5. **HTTP Client:** Req library chosen over alternatives per project guidelines

### Project Constraints Identified
- Must follow Phoenix 1.8 best practices and conventions
- Server-side rendering approach limits some client-side capabilities
- Real-time performance depends on WebSocket connectivity
- Scalability will depend on Elixir process management

## Current Environment Status

### Development Environment
- **Elixir Version:** 1.15+ required
- **Phoenix Version:** 1.8.0
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (connection status: needs verification)
- **Node.js:** Required for asset compilation
- **Git:** Feature branch `feature/init_plan` created

### Configuration Status
- **Development Config:** Standard Phoenix setup in `config/dev.exs`
- **Asset Pipeline:** ESBuild and TailwindCSS configured
- **Database:** Default configuration present, needs verification
- **Testing:** ExUnit setup with Phoenix.LiveViewTest

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Environment Verification (Today)
1. **Run Development Setup:**
   ```bash
   mix setup
   mix phx.server
   ```
2. **Verify Database Connectivity:**
   - Check PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify database creation and migrations
3. **Test Asset Compilation:**
   - Ensure TailwindCSS builds correctly
   - Verify ESBuild configuration

### Priority 2: Game Type Definition (Next 1-2 days)
1. **Define Specific Game:** Need to decide what type of game to implement
   - Consider complexity vs. development time
   - Evaluate real-time requirements
   - Define player interaction patterns
2. **Update Documentation:** Refine PRD and architecture based on game choice
3. **Plan Database Schema:** Design specific tables for chosen game type

### Priority 3: Initial Implementation (This week)
1. **Create Base Models:** Start with Game and Player Ecto schemas
2. **Set Up Contexts:** Implement basic business logic contexts
3. **Begin LiveView:** Create foundation LiveView structure

## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
- **Game Type:** Need to choose specific game to implement (board game, puzzle, etc.)
- **Authentication:** Decide if initial version needs user accounts
- **Multiplayer Scope:** Define concurrent player limits and session management
- **Persistence Strategy:** Determine what game data needs to be saved

### Development Workflow
- **Feature Branches:** Using Git feature branches for development
- **Quality Checks:** `mix precommit` must pass before merging
- **Testing Strategy:** Implement tests alongside feature development
- **Documentation:** Keep Memory Bank files updated with progress

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Reference
- **Memory Bank Files:** All 7 core files now established and current
- **Phoenix Configuration:** Standard Phoenix app in `lib/game_eight_web/`
- **Project Guidelines:** Detailed development rules in `AGENTS.md`
- **Mix Configuration:** Dependencies and tasks in `mix.exs`

### Important Notes
- Project follows Phoenix 1.8 conventions strictly
- LiveView is the primary UI technology (no separate frontend framework)
- Req library is preferred over other HTTP clients
- TailwindCSS and Heroicons for all styling and icons
- Server-side state management approach chosen for simplicity

### Current Blockers
- **None identified** at this stage
- Environment verification will determine any setup issues
- Game type decision needed before detailed implementation planning

## Work Handoff Notes

If continuing work in future sessions:
1. **Start with:** Environment verification tasks
2. **Reference:** Memory Bank files for current project state
3. **Focus on:** Game type definition and initial schema design
4. **Remember:** Follow Phoenix conventions and project guidelines strictly
5. **Update:** This active context file with progress and new decisions
