# Active Context - GameEight Development

## Current Work Focus
**Sprint Goal:** Implement Card Game - Phase 2 (LiveView Interface)
**Active Branch:** feature/game
**Current Task:** Creating LiveView game interface with real-time functionality

### Implementation Progress
**Specific Game Chosen:** Multiplayer Card Game (Rummy-style)
- **Decks:** 2 English decks (red/blue) = 104 cards
- **Players:** 2-6 players, 8 cards each initially
- **Mechanics:** Dice turns, trios/sequences, player states (off/on)
- **Limits:** 5 moves max, 4 hand cards max per turn
- **Interface:** Graphical UI with CSS, drag-and-drop functionality
- **Technology:** LiveView + TailwindCSS + JavaScript hooks
- **Interface:** Modern graphical UI with drag & drop (no ASCII)

### Phase 1: Data Structures (COMPLETED âœ…)
**Goal:** Create foundational card game data structures
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - All tests passing (150/150)

**Components Completed:**
- âœ… Card Module (`lib/game_eight/game/card.ex`): 104-card deck system with validation
- âœ… CSS Styling (`assets/css/app.css`): Complete card styling with animations
- âœ… GameState Schema (`lib/game_eight/game/game_state.ex`): Core game state management
- âœ… PlayerGameState Schema (`lib/game_eight/game/player_game_state.ex`): Player state handling
- âœ… Game Engine (`lib/game_eight/game/engine.ex`): Core game logic and turn management
- âœ… Database Migration: All tables created and applied
- âœ… Engine Tests (`test/game_eight/game/engine_test.exs`): 4 tests covering initialization and dice phase

### Phase 2: LiveView Interface (IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„)
**Goal:** Create real-time game interface with drag-and-drop
**Status:** LiveView foundation implemented - now implementing game logic

**Components Completed:**
- âœ… GameLive Module (`lib/game_eight_web/live/game_live.ex`): Main game interface with proper card visibility
- âœ… Router Integration: Added `/game/:room_id` route with authentication
- âœ… Game Context Extensions: Added `get_game_state_by_room/1` and `get_game_state_with_players/1`

**Key Interface Requirements Implemented:**
- **Card Visibility Rules:**
  - âœ… Each player sees ONLY their own hand cards
  - âœ… All players see cards played on the table (public combinations)
  - âœ… Players see top discard pile card and remaining deck count
  - âœ… Hide other players' hand cards (show only card backs/count)
- **Game State Display:**
  - âœ… Current turn indicator and dice results
  - âœ… Player status (player_on/player_off) and statistics
  - âœ… Move counts and limits per turn
- **UI Components:**
  - âœ… Player hand with card selection
  - âœ… Table combinations display
  - âœ… Other players' view (card backs only)
  - âœ… Game actions (play combination, draw card, pass turn)
  - âœ… Deck and discard pile display

**Next Tasks:**
1. Complete helper functions (load_game_data, get_players_data)
2. Implement event handlers (dice rolling, card playing, drawing)
3. Add real-time synchronization via PubSub
4. Add drag-and-drop JavaScript hooks
